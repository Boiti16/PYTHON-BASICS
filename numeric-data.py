#Numeric Data

#numbers in python are most commonly represented as integers or floats.
#Integers are whole numbers, while floats are numbers with decimal points.

num = 3
print(3)

num2 = 3.14

print(type(num))  # Output: <class 'int'>
print(type(num2))  # Output: <class 'float'>

#Operators in Numeric Data

#Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numeric data.
#Addition (+), 
# subtraction (-), 
# multiplication (*), 
# and division (/) 
# are the most common arithmetic operators.

#modulus (%) is used to find the remainder of a division operation.
#Exponentiation (**) is used to raise a number to a power.

x = 10
y = 2

#assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.
x = 10
x += 2 # equivalent to x = x + 2
